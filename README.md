# pico-piano
Rapberry Pi Pico + tact switches + buzzer = piano :)

So my son had a shool assignment where he had to build a music instrument of any kind. I helped him to wire some switches and a buzzer to a pico and wrote this simple code.

I only had 5 switches, but the code can be easily extended by adding items with pin number and frequency to buttons list.

I used the note frequencies from [here] (https://pages.mtu.edu/~suits/notefreqs.html)

You can use it to play for example "Soft Kitty" using these notes: 

G E E F D D C E G
G E E F D D C E C
C E E F D D C E G
G E E F D D C E G
